# Neo Postman

As a QA Engineer, we usually do an API testing with Postman but there are some weakness of Postman

```
1. Can't record the result
2. Can't do an assertion result
```

So their is neo-postman which help you to do an API testing and make your job more easier

| API Testing      | v                      | v                                     |
| Assertion result | v (but need put logic) | v (just put the expected result body) |
| Record           | x                      | v                                     |
